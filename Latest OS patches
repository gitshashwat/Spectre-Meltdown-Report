A detailed list of OS patches:

Windows:

Microsoft's process for releasing Windows updates addressing Meltdown and Spectre has been a bumpy road, marred by high-profile incompatibility issues with third-party antivirus (AV) software and AMD processors. 
In some cases, delivery of the latest security updates was temporarily restricted or suspended. 

Following are the updates provided by:

Windows 10 
version 1507 — KB4056893 (issued 1/3/18)


Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 
Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2— KB4056898 (issued 1/3/18) 
Update that disables Intel's Spectre variant 2 mitigation (which has caused issues) — KB4078130 (issued 27/1/18) 
Windows 8 and Server 2012 — KB4088877 (issued 3/13/18) 
Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2 — KB4088879 (issued 3/13/18)

No patches available for Windows Server 2012 non-R2 version


Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 
Windows 7 SP1 and Server 2008 R2 SP1 — KB4056897 (Security only, issued 1/3/18) 


Update that disables Intel's Spectre variant 2 mitigation (which has caused issues) — KB4078130 (issued 1/27/18) 



If you've installed any January, February, or March updates for Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 machines, install KB4100480 (issued 29/3/18) now.

It's an out-of-band update addressing a critical vulnerability (CVE-2018-1038) introduced by previous updates. 


No patches available for Windows Server 2008 non-R2 version


AMD compatibility issues: Microsoft has received numerous reports of PCs running AMD processors not booting after installing the latest Windows security update. After investigating, the company confirms there were issues and temporarily stopped delivering the update to AMD devices.
 Affected users needed to visit the support site of Microsoft for instructions on getting their machines back up and running. 

Performance impact: As with the other operating systems, patches addressing Meltdown and Spectre are expected to take a non-insignificant toll. Microsoft Executive VP Terry Myerson explains the impact of these fixes can vary depending on the version of Windows running and the age of the machine:

Windows 10 on 2016-era PCs with Skylake, Kabylake, or newer CPU: Single-digit slowdowns, which most users won't notice.
Windows 10 on 2015-era PCs with Haswell or older CPU:Slowdown can be more significant. Some users may notice a decrease in performance.
Windows 8 or Windows 7 on 2015-era PCs with Haswell or older CPU:Most users will likely notice a decrease in system performance.
Windows Server (any CPU): Mitigations to isolate code within a Windows Server intance results in a more significant performance impact. According to Myerson, "This is why you want to be careful to evaluate the risk of untrusted code for each Windows Server instance, and balance the security versus performance tradeoff for your environment."
macOS and iOS updates

Apple included mitigations to address Meltdown in its macOS 10.13.2 and iOS 11.2 updates released in December. It has since followed up with additional mitigations addressing Spectre with the just-issued macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 Supplemental Update and iOS 11.2.2 update.
What they address:
Meltdown (rogue data cache load — CVE-2017-5754)
Spectre variant 1 (bounds check bypass — CVE-2017-5753) to some degree
Spectre variant 2, (branch target injection — CVE-2017-5715) to some degree
What they dont' address:
Spectre variants 1 and 2 — to some degree
While Apple says its latest updates to macOS, iOS, and Safari help mitigate the risk of Spectre being exploited, the company acknowleges it will be continuing to develop and test further mitigations. 
No reported compatibility or performance issues

Linux updates
After being left out of the loop, Linux developers are making significant progress on patches. The latest update of the stable Linux kernel (4.14.13) includes patches designed to mitigate Meltdown with Page table isolation.

Patches have also been added to the 4.4 and 4.9 stable kernel trees.

Canonical has released a second update for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial users after the first caused boot issues. You can find the new update with Linux kernel image 4.4.0-109 here.
What they address:
Meltdown (rogue data cache load — CVE-2017-5754), though not currently for 32bit (x86) machines
Spectre variant 1 (bounds check bypass — CVE-2017-5753) to some degree
Spectre variant 2, (branch target injection — CVE-2017-5715) to some degree
What they dont' address:
Meltdown for 32bit (x86) machines 
Spectre variants 1 and 2 — to some degree


Patches have now been released that mitigate both variants of Spectre, but variant 2 mitigation also requires firmware/microcode updates to be in place. Because those updates are still being (re)developed and rolled out — keep in mind the latest recommendation from Intel was not to apply its firmware patches — variant 2 mitigation is currently incomplete. 

Known issues:
Patches haven't been released for machines running ARM64 processors:They are expected to be supported with the release of 4.15 in a couple of weeks.
Patches bricking Ubuntu 16.04 computers: Sources say boot issues have been reported by a large number of Ubuntu users running the Xenial 16.04 series after updating to kernel image 4.4.0-108. 
No Meltdown fix is currently available for 32bit (x86): Moving to a 64-bit kernel is the only currently recommended mitigation.
Spectre version 2 mitigations still reliant on firmware updates: As Intel and AMD continue to work through update difficulties mitigation remains incomplete.
Performance impact: Based on initial testing, performance penalties for the patches are expected to range from single to double digits, depending primarily on how much interaction applications/workloads have with the kernel.

A simple script has been developed to help determine whether Linux kernel installations are still vulnerable to Meltdown and Spectre after applying patches.
